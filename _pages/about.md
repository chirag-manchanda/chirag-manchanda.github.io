About Me
======

Hi, I'm Chirag!

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I work under the guidance of Prof. [Joshua Apte](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jsapte). 
My research focuses on bridging the gap between models and observations in air pollution studies. Recently, my work has centered on developing data-driven statistical methods that integrate multimodal pollutant measurements with traditional chemical transport models. This approach provides a comprehensive view of air pollution variability, linking emissions directly to population exposures.

While I'm deeply invested in advancing these methodological developments, I'm equally committed to leveraging them to extract insights that can better guide policies improving environmental exposures, health, and equity.

For a detailed overview of my academic and research journey, feel free to explore my [CV](https://chirag-manchanda.github.io/cv/).
