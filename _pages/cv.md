Research Experience
======
- **University of California, Berkeley** | _Graduate Student Researcher_
  
  Berkeley, CA | Apte Research Group
  Fall 2021 - Present

  *Data-driven modeling and Assimilation Methods for Enhancing Urban Air Quality*  
  - Designed a statistical framework integrating mobile and fixed-site pollutant measurements to generate high-resolution and comprehensive pollutant concentration fields, enhancing spatial density and temporal completeness.
  - Implemented an innovative inverse modeling routine leveraging diverse pollutant monitoring techniques to improve the accuracy of pollutant emission flux estimates, refining and constraining emission sources.
  - Developed a dynamical controllability framework to assess optimal control strategies for reducing pollution exposure levels and disparities, providing valuable insights into achieving targeted air quality goals.

- **Indian Institute of Technology Delhi** | _Research Associate_
  
  Delhi, India | Air Quality Research Group
  Summer 2018 - Summer 2021

  *Source Apportionment Analysis for Quantifying Variation in Sources of Ambient PM2.5 during Periods of Marked Variation in Anthropogenic Activities in Delhi*  
  - Investigated the variation in chemical composition and sources contributing to ambient PM2.5 during a major firework event (Diwali) and the COVID-induced lockdown, utilizing near-real-time elemental and organic particulate measurements.
  - PMF-based source apportionment analysis identified fireworks as the primary contributor, responsible for more than 95 percent of total elemental PM2.5 during the Diwali event. Additionally, during the last phase of the COVID lockdown, oxidized primary organic aerosol (OPOA) constituted over 40 percent of total organic PM2.5, attributed to elevated O3 concentrations.

  *On-road Exposure to Particulate Matter in New Delhi*  
  - Carried out on-road measurements to investigate in-vehicle exposure to particulate matter in Delhi, examining the influence of congestion intensity, land-use patterns, and vehicular speed on particulate levels.
  - Compared on-road measurements with predicted PM levels at each site, employing imputation and low-rank estimation techniques to account for missing data from monitoring stations across Delhi. This estimation provided an assessment of the actual risk associated with on-road exposure to particulate matter, considering values beyond average levels recorded at monitoring stations.

- **Nanyang Technological University Singapore** | _Research Associate_
  
  Singapore | School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
  Spring 2018 - Summer 2018

  *Non-Invasive Detection of Stenosis in Human Carotid Arteries*  
  - Conducted high-resolution transient simulations utilizing High-Performance Computing (HPC) nodes to investigate the detection of stenosis in human carotid arteries. Discovered that the Strouhal number associated with a vortex in the shear layer downstream of the stenosed region varied with the degree of stenosis. This variation was identified as a distinct thermal signature that could be extracted from the neck surface.
  - Correlated this variation with the temperature distribution on the neck surface, employing both numerical and experimental approaches. Utilized thermography and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish between patients with and without stenosis.

  *Numerical Modeling of Human Skin Subject to Transient Heating/Cooling Cycles*  
  - Conducted a comprehensive numerical study to examine the effect of external excitation duration (heating/cooling) and the relaxation period between consecutive excitation cycles on the depth of penetration of heating/cooling in human skin.
